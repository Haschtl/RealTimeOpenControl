Description: RealTime OpenControl enables simple real-time data recording, visualization and editing. The recording can be done with a local Python scripts or via TCP locally/from the network. Visualization and editing is available locally, in the network (TCP and HTML) and via Telegram on the smartphone.
        
        In addition to data recording, events can also be recorded. These can, for example, trigger a telegram message.
        
        Possible applications:
        
        - Central measurement data recording of laboratory instruments with PC connection (e.g. power supply unit, multimeter, sensors, microcontroller)
        - Central recording of measurement data from Internet devices (e.g. mobile weather stations, drones, smartphones)
        - Remote monitoring and control of processes and devices with PC and Smartphone (Telegram) (e.g. 3D printing, heating, Custom-SmartHome)
        - Controlling between several devices (e.g.: power regulation of a power supply unit on the temperature sensor of a multimeter)
        - Decentralized data recording (e.g. on Raspberry) and access via network connection (smart projects)
